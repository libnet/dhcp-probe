dhcp_probe NEWS - history of user-visible changes.


See the file ChangeLog for the details of all changes.


Version 1.2.2 - October 15 2008, by Irwin Tillman

* The default name of the pid file has changed from /etc/dhcp_probe.pid
  to /var/run/dhcp_probe.pid.  You can still override the default by
  specifying the '-p pidfile' command line option.

* New -T option to enable the 'socket receive timeout' feature.
  This may work around a problem on some platforms where the program
  waits forever for responses after sending a probe packet.
  This new feature does not work on all platforms.

* When exiting, the program will more consistently log an "exiting" 
  message.

  We no longer support the libnet 1.0.x API.  To compile this
  version, you must first upgrade libnet to 1.1.2.1.

  and chaddr fields).
