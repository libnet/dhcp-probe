Installing dhcp_probe


Note that the file INSTALL.generic contains generic build and 
installation instructions; it supplements this file (specifically,
the steps involving 'configure', 'make', and 'make install').

---

1. Obtain and install libpcap, the packet capture library.
It is available from http://www.tcpdump.org

For information about which versions of libpcap the
program has been succesfully used with (and whether any
versions should be avoided), see the PLATFORMS section below.

If libpcap isn't supported on your platform, you can't
use dhcp_probe.

Libpcap must be installed to compile dhcp_probe;
we assume we'll find the libpcap library and header files
in either /usr/local or the other usual places the compiler
and linker will search.  If you've installed it elsewhere,
when you run 'configure' below, remember to specify the
--with-pcap=DIR option.

--

2. Obtain and Install libnet, the packet writing library.
It is available from http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet

For information about which versions of libnet the
program has been succesfully used with (and whether any
versions should be avoided), see the PLATFORMS section below.

If libnet isn't supported on your platform, you can't
use dhcp_probe.

Libnet must be installed to compile the ARP Bomber;
we assume we'll find the libnet library and header files
in either /usr/local or the other usual places the compiler
and linker will search.  If you've installed it elsewhere,
when you run 'configure' below, remember to specify the
--with-libnet=DIR option.  We also assume we can find
the 'libnet-config' executable (installed as part of libnet)
somewhere in your path.

---

3. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
`./configure' to configure the package for your system, possibly 
specifying options such as --with-pcap=DIR or --with-libnet=DIR if these
are needed to help it locate those packages.

Note that because the present version of the program only runs on 
Solaris 8 SPARC, built with gcc 3.0.4 (it has not been ported to other platforms),
it ignores much of what 'configure' discovers about your platform.
Previously it has been built and run successfully on Solaris 7,
and with gcc 2.95.2 and 2.95.3.

More information about running 'configure' is available in the INSTALL.generic
file, and you may type './configure --help' for a summary of options.

---

4. Type `make' to compile the package.

Ignore the following compiler warning:

  bootp.c: In function `build_dhcp_payload':
  bootp.c:80: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer type

---

5. Type `make install' to install the package.

---

6. Create a configuration file dhcp_probe.cf in an appropriate location.

The default location for this file is /etc/dhcp_probe.cf, but you can put it
elsewhere, as long as you specify the new location when you run the program
using the appropriate command-line option.  

A sample configuration file is supplied in the 'extras' directory; you may wish 
to use it as a template.

---

7. To get started, try running it in the foreground and seeing if the debug messages 
seem reasonable to you.  E.g. as root:

   /usr/local/sbin/dhcp_probe -f -d 11 hme0

The -f option prevents it from forking, and also causes all output to be
sent to stderr instead of to syslog.  Debuglevel 11 will produce maximum
debugging.  Specify the name of the interface on which to run, e.g. 'hme0'.

---

8. Arrange to have the program started automatically by root when your host starts.  

Remove the -f option; this flag should never be specified except for debugging
purposes.    

You'll probably want to reduce the debuglevel; a debuglevel of 0 or 1 is generally
a good choice for production use.

Output will be directed to syslog (using the facility specified
in defaults.h); you'll want to configure syslogd to do something reasonable
with it.  (You can change the syslog facility name by editing defaults.h and
recompiling.)  Alternatively, use the -l option to specify a logfile to receive output;
this prevents syslog from being used.

---

9. If you want to capture packets received from unknown servers, add the -o
option when starting up, to specify a capture file.  Be sure to specify 
a directory for the capture file that no one may write to except root;
see the dhcp_probe(8) man page for details.

Since the program truncates this file each time it starts, you may want to
modify the script you use to start the program, to save the old version of
this file before starting the program.

---

10. Any additional tools you may find useful can be found in the 'extras' directory.

PLATFORMS

* Platforms known to work

The program has been succesfully built and used on the following platforms:

        Solaris 7 on SPARC
        gcc 2.95.2
        libpcap 0.4
        libnet 1.0.1b

        Solaris 8 on SPARC
        gcc 3.0.4
        libpcap 0.7.1
        libnet 1.0.2a


* libnet library

The current version of this program uses the libnet 1.0.x API.  It has not
been migrated to work with the libnet 1.1 API yet.  You will need to build
against a 1.0.x version of libnet.

If you build with recent compilers (e.g. gcc 3.x), the compiler may warn
about the multi-line '#error' directive in the libnet.h file supplied as part
of libnet 1.0.x.  This warning can prevent arp_bomber's 'configure' script
from working properly.  You can work around the problem by editing the libnet.h
file, to combine the multiple lines of the '#error' directive into a single line.
