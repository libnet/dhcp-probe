dhcp_probe.cf.sample is a sample dhcp_probe configuration file.  You may find
it useful to use as a template.

dhcp_probe_notify2 is a sample alert program, suitable for specification
via the alert_program_name2 configuration file statement.  It is a Perl script 
that sends email.  If you choose to use, it, install it someplace on your system 
where the dhcp_probe daemon can execute it.  You will need to edit the definitions 
at the top of this script.  Note that it calls the mail-throttled script below.

dhcp_probe_notify is a sample alert program, similar to dhcp_probe_notify2;
see the description above for 'dhcp_probe_notify2' for details.
Unlike dhcp_probe_notify2, this program supports the older syntax used by 
the alert_program_name configuration file statement, rather than the newer 
syntax used by the alert_program_name2 configuration file statement.
Because the older syntax is not extensible, this version cannot provide all the
same features as 'dhcp_probe_notify2'.

mail-throttled is a perl script called by dhcp_probe_notify2 or
dhcp_probe_notify to throttle the frequency of messages that share a unique "key" 
specified by its caller.  If you choose to use, it, install it someplace on your 
system where the dhcp_probe_notify script (called by dhcp_probe daemon) can execute it.
You will need to edit the definitions at the top.

dhcp_probe.startup.Solaris9 is a sample startup script that works in Solaris 9.
If you choose to use it, place it in /etc/init.d/ with the filename 'dhcp_probe',
and the symlinks documented in the script's comments.

dhcp_probe.FreeBSD.sh is a sample rcNG script for use with FreeBSD.
If you choose to use it, place it in /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ with the
filename 'dhcp_probe.sh', then enable it in /etc/rc.conf:
dhcp_probe_enable="YES"
dhcp_probe_flags="<interface>"

dhcp_probe.xml is a sample SMF manifest file and site-application-dhcp_probe 
is a sample Solaris method script, for use with Solaris SMF.
If you choose to use them, place site-application-dhcp_probe in
/lib/svc/method/site-application-dhcp_probe (for example), and
place dhcp_probe.xml in /var/svc/manifest/site/application/dhcp_probe.xml
(for example).  Edit dhcp_probe.xml to specify an instance for each 
network interface on which you wish to run the program, naming each instance
the same as the network interface name.    Edit site-application-dhcp_probe
as necessary.  Then import the manifest and enable each desired instance, for example:
  /usr/sbin/svccfg -v validate /var/svc/manifest/site/application/dhcp_probe.xml
  /usr/sbin/svccfg -v import   /var/svc/manifest/site/application/dhcp_probe.xml
  svcadm enable svc:/site/application/dhcp_probe:INSTANCE1
  svcadm enable svc:/site/application/dhcp_probe:INSTANCE2
  svcadm enable svc:/site/application/dhcp_probe:INSTANCE3
  etc.

rotate_logs is a log rotation utility which may optionally be used
by site-application-dhcp_probe to rotate packet capture files.
