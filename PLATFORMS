Platform-Specific Notes for dhcp_probe


FREEBSD

If the libnet 1.1.x header is installed in /usr/local/include/libnet11/
you will probably need to specify --with-libnet-include=/usr/local/include/libnet11/

If the libnet 1.1.x library is installed in /usr/local/lib/libnet11/
you will probably need to specify --with-libnet-lib=/usr/local/lib/libnet11/

You may need to specify --mandir=/usr/local/man at configure-time.
