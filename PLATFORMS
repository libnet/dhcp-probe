Platform-Specific Notes for dhcp_probe

The author develops this program on Solaris 10 on SPARC, so that is a platform you 
can expect to work.  The author has not ported the program to other platforms, and 
in fact, it currently ignores much of what 'configure' discovers.

Others have contributed patches to make this program run on several other platforms.
The author is usually unable to test whether these patches work on those platforms.



FREEBSD

If the libnet 1.1.x header is installed in /usr/local/include/libnet11/
you will probably need to specify --with-libnet-include=/usr/local/include/libnet11/

If the libnet 1.1.x library is installed in /usr/local/lib/libnet11/
you will probably need to specify --with-libnet-lib=/usr/local/lib/libnet11/

You may need to specify --mandir=/usr/local/man at configure-time.

following versions of Solaris; it is possible that the current version may still 
build and run on them, but this has not been verified by the author:
