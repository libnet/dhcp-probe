TODO for dhcp_probe

Fix whatever bug is causing the capture file to be unparseable after the
first packet.  (After one packet, tcpdump reports: 
"tcpdump: pcap_loop: truncated dump file".

Port to other platforms; stop ignoring most of what autoconf learns.
(Although the build process is autoconf-based, at
this time the program ignores almost everything autoconf discovers
about your system.  The product was developed on Solaris 7 with gcc 2.95.2,
and has not been ported to other platforms.  Despite the use of autoconf, the
code merrily makes assumptions that are only valid on Solaris 7.)
The use of autoconf here is mostly to provide a framework in case the
product is ported to other platforms in the future.

Allow specification of the syslog facility name on the commandline?

The legal_servers array initialized by read_configfile() should 
be created dynamically, rather than sized via compile-time definitions.

Add support for FDDI interfaces

Figure out how to eliminate the compiler warning in bootp.c
