TODO for dhcp_probe

If the legal_server_ethersrc feature passes additional testing,
update the documentation to stop referring to it as "experimental."

Fix whatever bug is causing the capture file to be unparseable after the
first packet.  (After one packet, tcpdump reports: 
"tcpdump: pcap_loop: truncated dump file".

Port to other platforms; stop ignoring most of what autoconf learns.
(Although the build process is autoconf-based, at
this time the program ignores almost everything autoconf discovers
about your system.  The product was developed on Solaris 7 with gcc 2.95.2,
and while it has since moved forward to more recent versions of Solaris
and gcc, it has not been ported to other platforms.  Despite the use of autoconf, the
code merrily makes assumptions that are only valid on Solaris with gcc,
or similar variations.
The use of autoconf here is mostly to provide a framework in case the
product is ported to other platforms in the future.

Allow specification of the syslog facility name on the commandline?

The legal_servers array initialized by read_configfile() should 
be created dynamically, rather than sized via compile-time definitions.

The lease_networks_of_concern_addr, lease_networks_of_concern_netmask,
and lease_networks_of_concern_addr_and_netmask arrays initialized by 
read_configfile() should be created dynamically, rather than sized 
via compile-time definitions.

Figure out how to eliminate the compiler warning in bootp.c

libpcap detection/configuration has not yet been updated to take
advantage of pcap-config introduced in libpcap 1.0.0.

Add appropriate libdirs to RUNPATH passed to linker.
