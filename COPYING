A number of items came from the sample code associated with 
"UNIX Network Programming: Volume 1", Second Edition, by W. Richard Stevens,
published by Prentice Hall PTR.  
That publication is Copyright (c) 1998 Prentice Hall PTR.
These items are:

  src/daemonize.c
  src/get_myeaddr.c
  src/get_myipaddr.c
  AC_CHECK_FUNC_PROTO  in aclocal.m4 and m4/ac_check_func_proto.m4
  AC_UNP_CHECK_TYPE    in aclocal.m4 and m4/ac_unp_check_type.m4

The sample code associated with that book is available from:
ftp://ftp.kohala.com/pub/rstevens/unpv12e.tar.gz

The macro AC_CHECK_STRUCT_FOR in aclocal.4 is copyrighted by Wes Hardaker
<wjhardaker at ucdavis dot edu>, and was obtained from the GNU autoconf macro archive
at http://research.cys.de/autoconf-archive/

Permission has been granted to use and distribute it under the following license,
which is a modified version of the GNU General Public License version 2:

 Every Autoconf macro presented on this web site is free software; you can

 As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives unlimited
 permission to copy, distribute and modify the configure scripts that are the
 output of Autoconf. You need not follow the terms of the GNU General Public
 License when using or distributing such scripts, even though portions of the
 text of Autoconf appear in them. The GNU General Public License (GPL) does
 govern all other use of the material that constitutes the Autoconf program.

 Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be copied (in certain
 cases, depending on the input) into the output of Autoconf. We call these the
 "data" portions. The rest of the Autoconf source text consists of comments plus
 executable code that decides which of the data portions to output in any given
 case. We call these comments and executable code the "non-data" portions.
 Autoconf never copies any of the non-data portions into its output.

 This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf released by the
 Free Software Foundation. When you make and distribute a modified version
 of Autoconf, you may extend this special exception to the GPL to apply to your
 modified version as well, *unless* your modified version has the potential to
 copy into its output some of the text that was the non-data portion of the
 version that you started with. (In other words, unless your change moves or
 copies text from the non-data portions to the data portions.) If your
 modification has such potential, you must delete any notice of this special
 exception to the GPL from your modified version.

A number of items are based on code from LPRng-2.0.8:

  * the macros AC_SYS_NERR, AC_SYS_ERRLIST, AC_DECL_SYS_ERRLIST, AC_DECL_SYS_ERR_DECL.
    These are in aclocal.m4 and also in m4/sys_errlist.m4.
    The macros are based very closely on code from LPRng's configure.in file.

  * much of lib/strerror.c

The macros are based very closely on code from LPRng's configure.in file.

LPRng-2.0.8 is distributed under the GNU General Public License (see the
COPYING.GPL file).
